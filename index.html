                                people view each other the mistrust and intolerence between all the caribbean people what are you thoughts and opinions about this topic ?  </p>

                                        I know for the caribbean country Haiti their history have definitely affected their current economic status today. Take a look at their history,
                                        there was once a time when Haiti was the one of the richest caribbean countries, many centuries ago. Haiti was first discovered by the spanish in 1492 when Christopher
                                        Columbus discovered the new world which would be dubbed the caribbean today. It wasn't until the 1600's when the french finally took over Haiti.
                                        Haiti became one of French's most successful countries exporting more sugar, flour, coffee etc than any other caribbean country at that time. However
                                        all this wealth was meaningless to the slaves whose blood, tears and sweat were spilt making it. These circumstances and more  led to the famous French revolution in which
                                        the african slaves rebelled against their french masters. This resulted in Haiti being the first caribbean country liberated from french colonial powers. Becoming the 
                                        first black republic in the caribbean. However I believe this was probably the worst thing that could happen to Haiti.

                                       <em class="link">@Brittanie Brown</em> you have to explain that one for me how does Haiti gaining independence first affect their economic status and how that relates
                                       to mistrust and intolerence seen in today society.

                                           Well <em class="link">@Ayodeji Adedipe</em> Haiti gained independence from France in 1804 this was before any other caribbean countires, as such when Haiti
                                           first gained their independence countries such as Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were still under European powers rule. As such at the time
                                           no country in the caribbean or in the EU wanted to do trade with Haiti. Back then no one wanted to do business with a country owned by slaves
                                           or by black men and women, thus with no profit coming into the country Haiti economy went downhill, even today more than a
                                           century later their is still mistrust between Haiti and other caribbean countries as trade between Haiti and others have little 
                                           improvement. Jamaica and other countries still aren't willing to do business with Haiti even after being freed from the European powers,
                                           It wasn't until 2003 trade agreements between Haiti and other caribbean countries have opened up. Allowing Haiti access to the regional
                                           market. Here is a link to more information for you to read should you want to find out more. <br/>

                                          I agree with <em class="link">@Brittanie Brown</em> just like our white master didn't want to buy or sell goods with Haiti it took our government more than a
                                          century to trust our fellow caribbean nation to start trading with them even now we scoff and Haitians and want nothing to do with them 
                                          despite that at one time during slavery they were the jewel of the caribbean and possibly the wealthiest and now fast foward many years
                                          they are nothing more than a poverty stricken country.

                                          In today's society can see evidence of intolerance towards the language that we naturally speak which is Patois and I beleive this
                                          is as a result of our history and our identity as a nation. Our history Jamaica's history has played a key part in why most people
                                          today in Jamaica don't want to accept Patois as Jamaica's official language.

                                          Yes it does, Jamaica speaks English because it was once a british colony when the slaves were brought from Africa they had their own
                                          language that they speak but the british forced their own language on them. Since Aug 6th 1962 we have gained independence from England
                                          but yet still we cling to their language and and have become gravely intolerant of our own language which is a mix of African language 
                                          and English we today we call it Patois. Patois is our culture that we Jamaicans should embrace in today's society speaking Patois is
                                          forwned upon today it is considered impolite or not satisfactory or by some atrocious just as our slave master thought that the slaves
                                          African traditions were atrocious. Remember our ancestors fought and died for our right to be free and express ourselves how we want
                                          yet we hold intolerance towards Patois and acceptance towards English which belongs to our once then slave masters. Here is a article 
                                          which futher cements my point made. <br/>

                                         I would like to contribute to this topic of conversation as it regards to intolerance CCJ vs the privy Council. So we all know
                                         like <em class="link">@Twannakay Dennis</em> said Jamaica and other caribbean countries were once English colonies. As such even during slavery times when they were
                                         any disputes it was left to our slave master to resolve the issue this has been the case throughout history even now. The privy council
                                         is Jamaica's final court of appeal meaning that the queen of England our once slave master will be the one to decide our fate should it
                                         be necessary as a last result but yet we claim to be free and independent. how can we be soo blind it goes without a doubt that the CCJ
                                         should be our final court of appeal let caribbean people decide the fate of caribbean people not our white slave masters.

                                            On the topic of intolerance I agree with <em class="link">@Kendra Banton</em> comment 100% the people in Jamaica have a unwillingness to let go of colonial powers influence and remain 
                                            prejudice against authority. When a fellow black man tells us to do something we fight their authority naturally we rebelled against
                                            our fellow brother but when a white man tells us to do something we keel over and do it right away. I feel this stems from slavery when the 
                                            white masters to be the onces to tell us what to do and pass judgement on us but when our fellow brother decided to revolt against their white
                                            master there were those slaves who sided with their master instead of their own some even betray their own. Currently we are making efforts to
                                            make the CCJ the final court of appeal but there are those who just like the slaves chose to remain by their master sides we have people who
                                            choose to stick with the privy council those people who are unwilling to accept the view that we should thoughly be free from colonial powers.

                                          I did some research on @4553 discussion about the CCJ vs the Privy council and found these readings.<br>
                                          <a href="https://today.caricom.org/2018/07/12/opinion-caribbean-court-of-justice-vs-the-privy-council/">https://today.caricom.org/2018/07/12/opinion-caribbean-court-of-justice-vs-the-privy-council/</a>

                                          <br/><br/>
                                          Based on these articles I can agree that the Jamaican people are intolerant to the lagal aspects and both benefits and reprocussions that would happen should the CCj
                                          be the final court of appeal the greatest obstacle for that to happen based on what i read would be the lack of political independence as having the CCJ be the final
                                          court of appeal opens it up to bias, favourtism and nepotism.
